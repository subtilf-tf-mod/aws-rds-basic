# Terraform module of  AWS - RDS Basic Instance - Just for learn purpose!!!

All terraform modules from my repositories is only for learn purpose, so it can be broken, incomplete or not working well!

So if you use that code be careful and you will be at your own!!! Good lucky!!!

# What is an RDS?
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.

Amazon RDS is available on several database instance types - optimized for memory, performance or I/O - and provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server. You can use the AWS Database Migration Service to easily migrate or replicate your existing databases to Amazon RDS.

# Motivation
I wrote a lot of codes using terraform modules and for each individual project I had to replicated the modules.

Therefore as terraform accept to work with remote repositories I decided to use github as my source of terraform modules.

# About the project
This project just store the common git files (license and readme.md) and terraform files (main, var and output).
